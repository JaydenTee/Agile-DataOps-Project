Duplicate Criteria Definition

To ensure data integrity, we defined strict criteria for identifying duplicate records. 
A record is considered a duplicate if its Primary Key (Surrogate Key) appears multiple times in the dataset, indicating an ingestion error (e.g., the same file loaded twice).

Sales Key - The SalesKey is the unique identifier for every transaction line item. If the same SalesKey exists > 1 time, it is a system duplicate.
OnlineSalesKey - The OnlineSalesKey uniquely identifies an online order line. Any repetition of this key is invalid.
ProductKey - Each product must have a unique ID. Duplicates here would cause a "Many-to-Many" explosion in joins.
CustomerKey - Each customer profile must be unique. Duplicate keys would inflate customer counts.
