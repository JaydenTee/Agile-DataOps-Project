The main purpose of this analysis was to look at sales performance across Southeast Asia (SEA). By doing this, we can see which countries are growing quickly and which store locations may not be performing as well, helping the Regional Sales Manager decide where to focus attention.

At the top of the dashboard, the key performance indicators give a quick overview of how the region is doing overall. The total revenue is currently $86.45M, which shows that SEA is an important contributor to the company’s overall sales. Alongside this, the total number of units sold is 380.73K, which highlights strong customer demand and also indicates a heavy operational workload for supply and distribution.

The dashboard also includes a map that helps visualize where revenue is coming from. The bubble sizes make it easy to spot the strongest markets right away. From this, it is clear that Thailand and Singapore are the two main revenue drivers, standing out much more than nearby markets such as Vietnam and Malaysia. This suggests that these two countries should remain key priorities for marketing and logistics efforts.

Looking at revenue trends over time, the line chart helps show which markets are growing versus staying flat. Thailand shows a strong increase in revenue between 2008 and 2009, making it the region’s fastest-growing market. Singapore, on the other hand, appears to be growing more slowly, which may mean Thailand deserves more investment and strategic focus moving forward.

Store-level performance is also highlighted through a bar chart that ranks revenue by location. This makes it easy to identify stores that are doing exceptionally well or poorly. One major issue stands out in Bangkok: Contoso Bangkok No.1 Store is generating less than half the revenue of Bangkok No.2, even though both are in the same city. This is a clear warning sign that something may be wrong at the No.1 store, such as management challenges, stock problems, or location disadvantages.

Finally, the dashboard includes a product category slicer, which allows the Regional Manager to explore performance in more detail. This is useful because overall revenue might look strong, but certain product categories could still be underperforming. The slicer helps answer questions like whether Thailand’s growth is being driven by categories such as Cameras or Home Appliances.
