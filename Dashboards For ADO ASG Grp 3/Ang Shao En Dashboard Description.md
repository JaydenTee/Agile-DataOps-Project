# Dashboard Component Analysis: Product Profitability & Performance
**Owner:** Product Owner (Shao En)

**Objective:** The objective of this analysis was to evaluate sales volume and profitability across the Contoso product portfolio to identify opportunities for inventory optimization.

*This was done on Year 2007*

## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The executive scoreboard at the top of the dashboard provides an immediate snapshot of the portfolio's financial performance.

### **Card 1: Sum of NET PROFIT**
* **Current Value:** **$2.51bn**
* **Definition:** This figure represents the absolute earnings of the organization after all costs (COGS, operational expenses) have been deducted from the Total Revenue.
* **Significance:** This is the "North Star" metric. While Revenue shows how much product we moved, Net Profit tells us if the business is actually sustainable. A high revenue with low profit would indicate an issue with pricing or high inventory costs, but the strong $2.51bn figure confirms healthy operational efficiency.

### **Card 2: Sum of TOTAL REVENUE**
* **Current Value:** **$4.35bn**
* **Definition:** The gross income generated from all sales transactions before any expenses are subtracted. It acts as the "Top Line" growth indicator.
* **Significance:** This measures market demand and market share. It answers the question: *"Are customers buying our products?"* Comparing this against Net Profit helps identify if our high-volume sellers (like the Projectors) are pricing correctly.

### **Card 3: PROFIT MARGIN %**
* **Current Value:** **57.62%**
* **Definition:** A calculated measure derived from `Net Profit / Total Revenue`. It indicates the percentage of every dollar earned that the company keeps as profit.
* **Significance:** This is the primary measure of Product Efficiency. A 57.62% margin is exceptionally high for hardware retail (where 20-30% is standard).
* **Insight:** This high percentage proves that our strategy of focusing on premium "Home Appliances" and high-end "Projectors" is working. We are not just selling *more* (Volume); we are selling *smart* (Value). It validates the decision to discontinue low-margin items like the MP3 players to protect this efficiency score.

## 2. The "Root Cause" Analyzer (Decomposition Tree)
* **Visual Type:** AI Decomposition Tree
* **Metric Analyzed:** `Sum of NETPROFIT`
* **Breakdown Dimensions:** Category $\rightarrow$ Brand $\rightarrow$ Color $\rightarrow$ Product

**Strategic Purpose:**
This is the dashboard's primary exploratory tool. Unlike standard static charts, this AI-driven visual enables the Product Manager to perform "Ad-Hoc Root Cause Analysis." It answers the question *“Where exactly is our profit coming from?”* by dynamically splitting the data at each level of the hierarchy.

> **Key Insight:** As visible in the active path, the tree identifies **Home Appliances** as the dominant category with **$781M** in profit. By drilling down, we reveal a critical insight for the supply chain team: the **Fabrikam** brand is the top performer within this category, and specifically, their "White" colored appliances are driving the highest returns. This suggests that customers prefer neutral aesthetics for appliances, guiding future design decisions.

## 3. Top 10 Leaders: Volume vs. Value (Combo Chart)
* **Visual Type:** Line and Clustered Column Chart
* **X-Axis:** Product Name
* **Y-Axis (Bars):** `Sum of TOTAL REVENUE` (Financial Value)
* **Y-Axis (Line):** `Sum of SALES QUANTITY` (Unit Volume)

**Strategic Purpose:**
This visual performs a Correlation Analysis between financial success (Bars) and operational demand (Line).
* **Why it matters:** A Product Manager needs to know if a product is a "Cash Cow" (High Revenue, High Volume) or a "Premium Niche" (High Revenue, Low Volume).

> **Key Insight:** The **Proseware Projector 1080p** series occupies the top three spots, showing massive revenue bars supported by a high-volume trend line. This correlation confirms that these are our "Star Products"—they are expensive *and* popular. Managing inventory for these is critical; a stockout here would be catastrophic for the bottom line.

## 4. The "Kill List": Bottom 10 Products (Table)
* **Visual Type:** Data Table (Sorted Ascending by Profit)
* **Columns:** `Product Name`, `Sum of NET PROFIT`, `Sum of SALES QUANTITY`

**Strategic Purpose:**
This visual directly addresses the User Story requirement to *"identify unpopular items for discontinuation."* By filtering for the "Bottom 10," it isolates the portfolio's "dead weight"—products that consume warehouse space and capital but generate negligible returns.

> **Key Insight:** The table exposes the **Contoso 4GB Portable MP3 Player** series (White, Yellow, Black) as the worst performers. These items are generating as little as **$4,420** in total profit. Compared to the millions generated by the top performers, these legacy items are statistically insignificant and are prime candidates for an immediate "End-of-Life" (EOL) liquidation strategy.

## 5. Temporal Control (Date Slicer)
* **Visual Type:** Filter / Slicer
* **Field:** `CALENDARYEAR` (2007, 2008, 2009)

**Strategic Purpose:**
Provides Temporal Context.
* **Why it matters:** Aggregate data can hide trends. This slicer empowers the user to answer time-sensitive questions like *“Did the recession in 2008 affect our Projector sales?”* or *“Are MP3 player sales declining year-over-year?”* It transforms the dashboard from a static snapshot into a dynamic historical analysis tool.
